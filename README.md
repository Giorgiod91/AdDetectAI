# YouTube Ad Classifier (Selenium + Machine Learning)
This project uses Python and Selenium to detect ads on YouTube, extract their content, and classify them into categories (e.g. tech, gaming, finance) using machine learning.

##  What It Does

- Launches a real Chrome session via Selenium
- Detects YouTube ads (pre-roll or mid-roll)
- Extracts visual/audio/text features from the ads
- Applies a machine learning model to classify ad types
- (Planned) Dashboards, insights, and user profiling

## Lernziel

I wanted to explore:
- How YouTube ads are structured and delivered
- How machine learning can turn raw media into labeled, usable data
- How to build a practical ML pipeline using real-world data
